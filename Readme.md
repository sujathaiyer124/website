 # Project README

## Overview

This project showcases various styling improvements and animations that enhance the user experience. Below are the specific changes made:

### 1. Navbar Color Change with Hover Effect
- The background color of the navbar has been modified to ensure better visibility on hover. 
- On hovering over the navbar items, the color changes, providing a more interactive experience.

### 2. Paragraph Animation on Page Load
- An animation has been added to the paragraphs within the page.
- When the page is first loaded, the paragraph will smoothly animate into view, adding a dynamic touch to the content.
- This animation enhances the user engagement as they load the page.

### 3. Main Section Grid Layout and Hover Effect
- A grid-like structure has been implemented in the main section of the page.
- The items within the grid will slightly "lift" or show up when hovered over, creating a hover effect for a more modern, interactive layout.
  
### 4. Other Section Background Color and Tile-like Item Styling
- The background color of the "Other Section" has been updated for a fresher look.
- The items within this section now follow a tile-like structure, making the section look more organized.
- Additionally, an animation has been added to these tiles, where they react to hover by slightly moving or changing, improving the overall visual appeal.
